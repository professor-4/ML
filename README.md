## Machine Learning and Data Science
Machine learning creates a useful model or program by autonomously testing many solutions against the available data and finding the best fit for the problem. This means machine learning is great at solving problems that are extremely labor intensive for humans. It can inform decisions and make predictions about complex topics in an efficient and reliable way.Machine learning is one of the many tools in the belt of a data scientist. In order to make machine learning work, you need a skilled data scientist who can organize data and apply the proper tools to fully make use of the numbers.Data science is a rapidly growing field with massive potential. It is a broad, interdisciplinary field that harnesses the widespread amounts of data and processing power available to gain insights. One of the most exciting technologies in modern data science is machine learning. Machine learning allows computers to autonomously learn from the wealth of data that is available.
